<p><blockquote>A customer writes in saying their “site won’t build”. You have access to their build logs, and there you see this error: Build failed due to a user error: Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2. You have no more information than this and the site’s source repository is private so you cannot test the build yourself. How would you troubleshoot this issue? Please compose your best customer-facing answer.</blockquote></p>

<p>If all the build log shows is this error, and no other information, I am going to have to share basic troubleshooting steps to the customer to help steer them torward a resolution through iterations. I might write something like the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hello (customer first name),<br><br>
Thank you for writing. This error can occur under a number of different scenarios. To work through this issue I'd start by asking if you have been able to successfully run a build previously? If so, let's take a look back at the last successful build, reverting your site to this build, and re-introduce your updates to your code one at a time, so that we can identify the change that introduced the issue.<p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any additional questions we can assist with<p>
<p>I look forward to hearing how it goes, and to seeing your successful build!</p>
<p>Best,<br>
