<p><blockquote>Talk about how you made your site and why you chose the tools you did. Briefly explain one challenge you experienced in setting up this site and how you solved it.</blockquote></p>

<p>Looking at all of the options available, after initially trying out Netlify CMS, I decided to go with Jekyll to build this site. I made this decision after getting the CMS all set up and quickly realizing that I probably didn't have time to learn the system as well as I would want or need to in order to finish this exercise. I had also previously heard of Jekyll but have never tried it out so thought I'd give it a try.</p>
<p>Once I got Jekyll deployed to Netlify, I cloned the repo locally and then added the repo folder to Atom as a project folder so I could get to work.</p>
<p>I thought it would be nice to include all of the answers on the home page and so I searched for a way to do it, and quickly found the code needed to include on the index.html file to show posts on the home page. I opted to do this rathe than just posting everything in the index.html because I wanted to keep the functionality of Jekyll at the heart of the site, rather than just creating a static HTML page.</p>

<p>One challenge I had right after deploying was in the Neflity setup steps, with Step 2 offering me to use a custom domain, and getting a bit stuck on wether I needed to set one up (register a domain and all that). I decided to just skip that step and see what happened, and found that the site was hosted at the URL that was set up by Netlify and I didn't need to use a custom domain.</p>

<p><blockquote>What did you think of our service during the time you used it? Provide either some constructive criticism or some points that impressed you. Be honest! “It sucked” isn’t a wrong answer unless you don’t elaborate and provide some constructive criticism ;)</blockquote></p>

<p>I think the service is great! As someone completely new to Netlify, as well being somewhat new to deploying different site building stacks, it made the job very easy and accessible. The one thing I might suggest is to maybe add some tooltips or other directions when getting to Step 2, so that a total noob like me could simply move on and not feel a need to set up a custom domain.</p>

<p><blockquote>Provide a link to documentation for a technical/developer-focused product, which you think are well done, and explain why you think they are well done.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm a big fan of the documentation provided by Stripe: https://stripe.com/docs<p>
<p>Stripe has done a fantastic job of setting up a documentation site that is well structured, filled with very well written and helpful documentation, and is pleasing to look at. In addition to providing clear and helpful documentation on the functions they offer, they also provide great examples that can be cloned for testing. I think it's one of the best documented solutions I've seen.</p>

<p><blockquote>Why do you think SSL/HTTPS is important? Please provide at least 3 reasons.</blockquote></p>
<ul>
  <li>SSL/HTTPS is important because it helps protect users of the internet by providing trusted sources and by helping to protect their personal information</li>
  <li>SSL/HTTPS is important because it helps businesses build trust in their visitors/customers, and helps protect their sites</li>
  <li>SSL/HTTPS is important because it authenticates all the things!
</ul>

<p><blockquote>A customer writes in saying their “site won’t build”. You have access to their build logs, and there you see this error: Build failed due to a user error: Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2. You have no more information than this and the site’s source repository is private so you cannot test the build yourself. How would you troubleshoot this issue? Please compose your best customer-facing answer.</blockquote></p>


<p><blockquote>How would you set up an http 301 status redirect from “/netlify/anything” on your site, to https://www.google.com/search?q=anything How about a proxy redirect? Please add that proxy redirect rule to your site.</blockquote></p>


<p><blockquote>Please attempt to deploy a function on our service. This need not be complicated, could be "Hello World" or something fancier. Note that failure to deploy is not failing the exercise! Whether you have trouble or not, please describe what you experienced and how you attempted to troubleshoot, instead. We won't be asking you to share the function (but you can if you want to!), we just want to hear about the experience in some detail.</blockquote></p>


<p><blockquote>We understand you don't know anything about our internal procedures at this stage, but we want you to explain at a high level how you'd react to this situation: You receive a report of a severe security issue on www.netlify.com. You can't immediately confirm, so what steps might you take to investigate or substantiate the report? What might you say to the reporter, even though we haven't confirmed their assertion yet, that will still leave the true impression that our business is very concerned about security? You believe there is a reasonable chance the report is correct and the problem is very large and impactful. How might you escalate?
(optional/bonus) Could you give us a suggestion to improve this test or the job posting?</blockquote></p>
