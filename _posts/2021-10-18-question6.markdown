<p><blockquote>Explain, in a couple of paragraphs, what you think 2 major challenges around DNS configuration are for less-technical customers hosting websites.</blockquote></p>

<p>One issue I've seen less-technical people have with DNS and hosting their website shows up when they register their domain with one service, and host their site with another. Problems can show up with knowing how to find the nameservers that the hosting company provides, and knowing where to put that information on the registrare side so that the domain uses the hosting name servers.</p>
<p>Another very common issue I've seen people ask about over the years is with how quickly a domain will propegate. Less-technical people, or those new to setting up DNS, often don't know that it can take some time (we typically say to allow up to 72 hours) for a domain to propegate. It's often expected that as soon as DNS settings are saved, the website will be live... which as we all know simply is not the case.</p>
