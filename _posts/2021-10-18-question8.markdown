<p><blockquote>How would you set up an http 301 status redirect from “/netlify/anything” on your site, to https://www.google.com/search?q=anything How about a proxy redirect? Please add that proxy redirect rule to your site.</blockquote></p>

<p>To set up the 301 redirect I would use the netlify.toml file and add the following (with help from <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/rewrites-proxies/">https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/rewrites-proxies/</a>):</p>
{% highlight html linenos %}
  [[redirects]]
  from = "/netlify/anything"
  to = "https://www.google.com/search?q=anything"
  status = 301
  force = true
  headers = {X-From = "Netlify"}
{% endhighlight %}


<p>Adding a proxy redirect I'd also use the netlify.toml file.
{% highlight html linenos %}
[[redirects]]
  from = "/proxy"
  to = "https://swapi.dev/api/people/1/"
  status = 200
  force = true
  headers = {X-From = "Netlify"}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>You can see it in action, here: <a href="https://itsallgood.netlify.app/proxy">https://itsallgood.netlify.app/proxy</a></p>
